Amend this Readme in your forked repo and use your commits to outline the component you have created and the decisions that you have made.

I've used LESS to style the Recommendations component, and I got help of JQUERY whilst building it.
-	LESS file is also available in css folder for review.

To accomplish responsiveness and a good user experience, I've used SLICK which is an opensource carousel component with many useful build in functions.
-	SLICK reference: http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/

To localize the prices Iâ€™ve used the ISO country code I got from the linkURL of a product since there was no other localized information within the recommendations.json file. It would be better to add another field to the json file to specify the local/currency, which could be used in js instead of the linkURL.
